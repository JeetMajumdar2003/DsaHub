/**
 * Graph Algorithms in C++17:
 * Graphs are fundamental data structures used to model relationships between entities.
 * They consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links).
 * Common graph algorithms include:
 * 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for traversing graphs.
 * 2. Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms for finding the shortest path.
 * 3. Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
 * 4. Topological Sorting for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
 * 5. Network Flow algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson for computing maximum flow.
 * These algorithms have applications in various fields such as computer networking, social network analysis, transportation, and logistics.
 * 
 * Applications:
 * - Social Networks: Analyzing connections and influence among users.
 * - Transportation: Finding optimal routes and traffic management.
 * - Web Search: Page ranking algorithms like Google's PageRank.
 * - Biology: Modeling biological networks and interactions.
 * - Telecommunications: Network design and optimization.
 * - Game Development: Pathfinding for AI characters.
 * - Recommendation Systems: Suggesting products based on user-item interaction graphs.
 * - Robotics: Navigation and mapping using graph-based algorithms.
